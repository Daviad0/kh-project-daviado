# Secureaty

Hi there, I am so glad you are taking a look at my hackathon project for KuriusHacks Christmas Edition 2020! I was so excited, I prepared a webpage for people to read as an introduction instead of a README.md. This webpage has all you need to know about the platform (including challenge taken and all that, but I took challenge 1).

## Using Glitch

For this project, I used glitch web hosting (like an online IDE). I actually exported it to GitHub and did it all locally before doing a final push to Glitch, so I had to unfortunately transfer away from Lato font to Helvetica :(.

Please use this link to read the guide to the website made especially for judges and people who like to look at project galleries (I know I do): https://secureaty.glitch.me/guide (**NOTE: I am very confident in the ability for all of this free stuff from Glitch and MongoDB, but I am not confident in the startup time. Due to the backend on the website, Glitch may need to temporarily sleep the website to save resources. Please give it time to start back up (it will show you that it's doing that when it needs to)**)

Thanks!
